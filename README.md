# Google Keep - Full Screen - Browser Extension

## Latest Version: 1.2.2
 - Allows Google Keep editing to use the full browser window.
 - Allows toggling full screen on and off by clicking on an icon added on the notes.
 - Remembers full screen status across sessions
 - Supports Dark Mode

## Warning
Use this extension at your own risk. It shouldn't cause problems, but I can't make any guarantees, so back up critical notes.

## Note
    1. This extension only works with the web version of Google Keep (eg. https://keep.google.com/keep/) - it won't work with the "app" version (the one you might install and launch from your app menu in Chrome, especially for offline use).
    2. At this time, clicking the extension icon itself does not toggle anything - click the full-screen icon added to the note itself to toggle full-screen on and off.

## Instructions
Full-screen is enabled by default when you install the extension.  As of 1.1.1, full-screen is
supported for creating new notes in addition to editing notes.  Use the icon at the bottom of the note to toggle full-screen on and off as needed.
