# Google Keep - Full Screen - Browser Extension

## Latest Version: 1.2.3

-   Allows Google Keep editing to use the full browser window.
-   Allows toggling full screen on and off by clicking on an icon added on the notes.
-   Remembers full screen status across sessions
-   Supports Dark Mode
-   Works with non-English language settings

## Warning

Use this extension at your own risk. It shouldn't cause problems, but I can't make any guarantees, so back up critical notes.

## Notes

    1. This extension only works with the web version of Google Keep (eg. https://keep.google.com/keep/) - it won't work with the "app" version (the one you might install and launch from your app menu -ie. for offline use).
    2. At this time, clicking the extension icon itself does not toggle anything - click the full-screen icon added to the note itself to toggle full-screen on and off.

## Instructions

-   Full-screen is enabled by default when you install the extension.
-   Use the icon at the bottom of the note to toggle full-screen on and off as needed.
-   Your selection will be remembered between notes and sessions.
